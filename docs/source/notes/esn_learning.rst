Echo State Network learning mechanics
=====================================

This note will present an overview of how Echo State Networks works works
and its learning mechanics. It's not mandatory to understand the complete
learning phase, but we recommend understanding the differnce between
classical ESN learning and gradient descent, it will help you to choose
which one to use according to cases.
